The Async Nature of Cypress:

Cypress is known for its asynchronous behavior, which is often blamed for flaky tests. While this is partly true, the real problem lies in the misunderstanding and incorrect use of Cypress’s async nature.

Many developers skip or skim the documentation, then mix synchronous JavaScript with asynchronous Cypress commands, treating them the same — which leads to confusion and errors.

Asynchronous thinking doesn’t come naturally; it takes practice and mistakes to grasp.
This blog aims to give a clear and practical explanation of Cypress’s asynchrony — not through theory, but with visuals and diagrams, to make learning easier and more intuitive.


Here’s a **clear and easy-to-understand summary** of the key concepts from your explanation on **Understanding the Asynchronous Nature of Cypress**:

## 🌀 **The Asynchronous Nature of Cypress (Simplified)**

Before we dive into visuals and timelines, let’s first understand a few **core concepts** that explain how Cypress works under the hood.

---

### ✅ **1. Cypress Commands Run Asynchronously (But in Order)**

Cypress commands like `cy.get()`, `cy.click()`, or `cy.visit()` **do not run immediately**.
Instead, they are added to a **command queue** and executed later, one by one, in the order they appear.

🧠 **Think of it like a to-do list**:
Cypress lines up all your commands and then runs them step-by-step.

---

### ✅ **2. Cypress Commands Yield (Not Return)**

You **can’t store Cypress results in variables** like this:

```js
const button = cy.get('button'); // ❌ This won't work!
button.click(); // ❌ Error
```

Why? Because `cy.get()` doesn't return the button element — it **yields** it **to the next command** in the chain.

✅ Correct way:

```js
cy.get('button')
  .should('contain', 'Click me!')
  .click(); // This works!
```

Here, Cypress waits for the button, checks its text, then clicks it — all in sequence.

---

### ✅ **3. Cypress Commands Are Not Promises**

Cypress commands **look like Promises**, but they’re not.

* You **can’t use `async/await`** in Cypress tests.
* Instead, Cypress uses **Chainables** — special objects that let you keep chaining commands until each finishes.

---

### 🔁 **4. Useful Tools: `.then()` and `cy.wrap()`**

#### 🔹 `.then()` – Work With the Result

Use `.then()` when you need to **access the result** of a Cypress command and do something with it.

```js
cy.get('button').then(($btn) => {
  console.log($btn.text()); // Logs the button’s text
});
```

> Inside `.then()`, `$btn` is a **jQuery element**, not a Cypress object.

#### 🔹 `cy.wrap()` – Re-enter the Cypress Chain

If you want to keep using Cypress commands **after working with a regular object**, use `cy.wrap()` to bring it back into the Cypress world.

```js
const myObj = { name: 'Test' };

cy.wrap(myObj)
  .its('name')
  .should('equal', 'Test');
```

Another example using `.then()` and `.wrap()`:

```js
cy.get('button').then(($btn) => {
  const oldClass = $btn.attr('class');
  cy.wrap($btn).click().should('not.have.class', oldClass);
});
```

---

### ❗ Important Notes

* **Cypress commands inside `.then()` must finish before the next command outside `.then()` runs.**
* You **can’t use `.catch()`** for failed Cypress commands. If a command fails, **the test stops immediately**.

Attention when mixing Javasciprt and Cypress 
The first is the JavaScript ,executed by the browser, which runs the JavaScript code synchronously, one statement after another.

The second time line is the Cypress queue, which follows its own pace,"in parallel" with the JavaScript

1 :

it('example', () => {
  console.log('1');               // Runs immediately (JS timeline)
  cy.get('button');              // Queued in Cypress, not run yet
  console.log('2');               // Runs immediately
  cy.click();                    // Queued
  console.log('3');               // Runs immediately
});

When you write Cypress commands like cy.get(), cy.click(), or cy.visit(), they are not executed immediately.
Instead, Cypress puts them into a queue, and only runs them after all the synchronous JavaScript in that block is finished.


console.log() is synchronous, so it runs immediately.

cy.log() is asynchronous — Cypress adds it to a command queue, which executes later after all sync code finishes.



Cypress waits for the JavaScript code to finish inside certain Cypress-defined blocks before it starts running its command queue.

✅ Cypress waits until these components finish:
Cypress Block / Component	Description
it()	The test itself. Commands are queued, then Cypress runs them after this block ends.
before()	Runs once before all tests. Cypress waits for this block to finish JS execution.
beforeEach()	Runs before each test. Cypress queues commands and waits for JS to finish.
after()	Runs once after all tests. Same queue behavior.
afterEach()	Runs after each test. JS runs first, then queued Cypress commands execute.
.then()	A special Cypress command block. Cypress pauses command execution and runs the callback inside .then() in JS sync time before continuing with command execution.
.each()	Iterates over elements — callback JS runs first, Cypress waits for it to queue more commands.
.should()	The assertion callback runs synchronously in JS, while Cypress polls for the condition.
.within()	Changes DOM context. Cypress waits until the inner block ends.


each 
cy.get('.item').each(($el, index, $list) => {
  console.log(`Index: ${index}`);  // JS runs immediately
  cy.wrap($el).click();            // Cypress queues this command
  console.log('Click queued');     // JS still runs immediately
});


should
cy.get('.success-message')
  .should(($el) => {
    console.log('Running .should callback');  // JS runs immediately
    expect($el.text()).to.include('Success'); // Cypress waits until this is true
  });
